This presentation at the local computer forum - <a href="http://foco.up.com.br/">FOCO</a> - was about the website called 'Sistema GPBUS' that provided several types of information (e.g., routes, position) regarding the bus system in Curitiba using the Google Maps API and data collected from the bus company Urbs. This project was originally developed as the final project of  SENAI's Information Technology technician course.
